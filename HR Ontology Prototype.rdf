It cannot just imparting knowledge of the relevant company&apos;s so and so. That wouldn&apos;t cover outsourced training, which involves hiring a specialized company to host a training session.

        <obo:IAO_0000232>Issue: Industry Conferences are often introduced as a type of employee training program. Should this be classified as a subclass of employee training or a subclass of conference? Such conferences certainly are used for employee training purposes. 

It might be more appropriate to say that it is a conference (and have it be defined by whatever makes conferences conferences) that has acts of employee training as parts. Thus, they have as parts training sessions on industry-specific skill sets through workshops and seminars.

They involve networking as part. But while networking often involves imparting job applicable knowledge and skills, we shouldn&apos;t say that it is the same thing as training, I think.</obo:IAO_0000232>

        <rdfs:comment>Apparently, the process &apos;active listening&apos; is not a subtype of listening. Rather, it appears to be a process aggregate having an act of careful or attentive listening as a member part: &quot;Active listening is the practice of preparing to listen, observing what verbal and non-verbal messages are being sent, and then providing appropriate feedback for the sake of showing attentiveness to the message being presented.[1] Active listening is listening on purpose.[2] Active listening is being fully engaged while another person is talking to you. It is listening with the intent to understand the other person fully, rather than listening to respond. Active listening includes asking wide-eyed questions such as, &quot;How did you feel?&quot; or &quot;What did you think?&quot;.[3] This form of listening conveys a mutual understanding between speaker and listener. Speakers receive confirmation their point is coming across and listeners absorb more content and understanding by being consciously engaged. The overall goal of active listening is to eliminate any misunderstandings and establish clear communication of thoughts and ideas between the speaker and listener.[4]&quot; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_listening

Notice that the overall goal is to eliminate misunderstandings and establish clear communication.</rdfs:comment>
        <rdfs:comment>This skill overlaps to some extent with observation, as listening is a form of observation.</rdfs:comment>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>A Nature of Action Identifier that designates some [].

Not really sure how to define this now. This class of NOAs, corresponding to 100 series nature of action codes, covers appointments, reinstatements, and transfers. It does not cover conversions to appointments (from other appointments)--those fall under 500 series codes.

Chapter 13 of the OPM Guide to Personnel Actions seemingly distinguishes appointments from conversions: &quot;2. Definitions.
a. An appointment establishes an 
individual as an employee of the agency.
b. A conversion changes an employee 
from one appointment to another 
appointment in the same agency without a 
break in service (for example, from the 
competitive service to the Senior Executive 
Service, from a Senior Executive Service 
Noncareer to a Senior Executive Service 
Career Appointment or vice versa, or from 
the excepted service to the Senior Executive 
Service).&quot;

This seems to restrict appointments to cases where a non-employee becomes an employee of an agency.

But this clearly conflicts with the use of appointment in Chapter 9:

&quot;1. Coverage 
This chapter covers permanent appointments in the competitive 
service by: 
a. appointment from a civil service certificate or under a direct hire 
recruiting authority or special authority; 
b. conversion or change of appointment, under either the same or 
a different authority, in the same agency without a break in 
service;&quot;

Which implies that conversion is a type of appointing.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

I think that eventually attrition types are going under change of quality.</rdfs:comment>
        <rdfs:comment>Note that whatever superclass is given for these various types:

That superclass cannot be defined as a reduction in the number of employees in the company. For that would exclude the type &apos;Internal Attrition&apos;, which has to do with one department losing employees to another department in the same organization.

Should be defined as a reduction in the number of members of some Organization, or in the number of members of some suborganization of that Organization.</rdfs:comment>

        <obo:IAO_0000232>The clause &apos;as well as other Intentional Acts which aid in the facilitation of such Acts of Communication&apos; is their to cover Intentional Acts such as listening, observing, making eye contact, body language, and the like.

Thus, being able to read the room (a type of observation) helps you to pick the right communication method, tone, etc, and so facilitates clear communication.</obo:IAO_0000232>
        <obo:IAO_0000232>The definition surely needs refinement, for as it stands, it is too restrictive. [This note can eventually be reworded as an elucidation of the definition once it is fixed.]

It currently only covers one aspect of Communication Skill: the speaker&apos;s capacity to convey information clearly, effectively, and efficiently. 

It may not sufficiently cover the receptive side of Communication Skill. This includes:
-listening, empathizing, observing.
I noted that the &apos;as well as other Intentional Acts which aid in the facilitation of such Acts of Communication&apos; is their to cover Intentional Acts such as listening, observing, making eye contact, body language, and the like which help facilitate communication that is clear, effective, and efficient.
-Thus, listening and observing well might enable the speaker to convey their ideas well. E.g., actively listening to your interlocutor facilitates your understanding of them, which will help you avoid confusions that may otherwise lead to subsequent poor communication on your part.

-But while this skill plays a role in enabling the speaker to communicate their ideas well to other, it is not just a skill realized by such acts. It is a skill that the speaker realizes when recieving information conveyed by the other interlocutor(s).

I guess it depends what the scope is for CCO&apos;s Act of Communication. That class is defines as: A Planned Act in which some Information Content Entity is transferred from some Agent to Another.

-When I observe someone else&apos;s body language, I pick up information about that person, for instance if they are squirming in their chair this conveys the information that they are nervous. But is it a case of that Person transferring information to me? I don&apos;t see why not.

It also doesn&apos;t cover Communication Skills that are not primarily oriented towards the goal of clear, effective, efficient communication. 
Example: friendliness, respectfulness. 
-Of course, communicating in a friendly and respectful manner may also aid in the facilitation of effective information transfer, but that is not the primary intention of being friendly and respectful.</obo:IAO_0000232>

A Term Appointment Action results in the Employee serving in an appointment that is expected to last for a specified period of time lasting at least more than one year, but no more than four years. The logical axiom thus says that the appointment results in the Employee serving in an appointment (the Act of Employment) that occurs over a Term Appointment Period. A Term Appointment Period is a one-dimensional temporal region that spans more than one year, but no more than 4 years. It is a defined class which has its own axiomatization.</CommonCoreOntologies:elucidation>

        <rdfs:comment>From wikipedia (plus my further thoughts)

it has to do with the &quot;effective and efficient management of people in a company or organization such that they help their business gain a competitive advantage&quot;. 
[Comment: is this process the sole purview of Agents in the Human Resources department? If so, such a description doesn&apos;t really narrow things down sufficiently so as to exclude acts that are the purview of Non-HR members of an organization. Non-HR managers are also engaging in acts of managing people in a company in order to gain a competitive advantage.]

-HRM is primarily concerned with the management of people within an organization by means of overseeing policies and company systems.
[Comment: once again, if a non-HR person works on policy or systems, are they engaged in human resource management. If not, then need to word things so that there acts are not encompassed]

HR departments are responsible for overseeing:
-employee-benefits design, 
-employee recruitment, 
-training and development, 
-performance appraisal
-reward management, such as managing pay and employee benefits systems.

[Comment: need to make explicitly clear what &apos;overseeing&apos; entails here. Consider for instance Outsourced Employee Training, or Act of Training where a long term employee in a given department trains a new hire from that same department. Neither the the outsourced trainer or the long term employee need be an HR agent.]

-HR professionals &quot;can specialize in finding, recruiting, selecting, training, and developing employees, as well as maintaining employee relations or benefits. Training and development professionals ensure that employees are trained and have continuous development.&quot;
[Comment: make clear HR&apos;s role in &apos;ensuring&apos; employees are trained, or recruiting. Distinguish from the role that non-HR plays in it]</rdfs:comment>

This can be because of an employees bad behaviour. [This is clearly referring to firing. But employee firing is already an act of its own. So I think this confirms that &apos;attrition&apos; here is referring to a reduction in employee numbers, however it came about.]

Or it can occur when company has to eliminate an employee position, or it has to layoff employees due to some worrisome economic condition.

        <rdfs:comment>I should perhaps use &apos;processed&apos; in the subclass definitions. 

Thus, there are Personnel Actions taken by the Agency (e.g. firings) and those taken by the Employee (voluntary retirement).

And in each case the Agency processes the Personnel Action. As in:

Guide to Processing Personnel Actions, Section: 3. Documentation of Personnel Actions: 
&quot;a) Request for Personnel Action. For most of the personnel actions you process, there will be a Request for Personnel Action, Standard Form 52, or a similar agency form approved by the Office of Personnel Management...&quot;</rdfs:comment>
        <rdfs:comment>Personnel actions must be authorized:

&quot;The legal authority is the law, Executive Order, regulation, agency directive, or the instruction under which the personnel action is taken. While the nature of action identifies the personnel action, the authority identifies the specific circumstances under which the action is taken.&quot;
p. 6 https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation/processing-personnel-actions/gppa01.pdf

So, do we only count processes as instances of Personnel Action if they have been authorized by one of the above?

Information which in turn can be used to facilitate better communication with one&apos;s audience and/or interlocutor(s).</CommonCoreOntologies:elucidation>
        <rdfs:comment>I think this is a defined class. Observational Skills would be inferred under here, rather than asserting them as subtypes. Because the same observational skills may be relevant to doing other types of acts well. For instance, the observational skills that help facilitate better communication with an interlocutor--such as picking up important cues from someone&apos;s body language--may also be the same observational skills that are involved in detective work. Thus, observing certain body language may be a detective skill that facilitates detection of a person&apos;s guilt in a crime. 

Thus, Observational Skill would be the top node of a separate branch of the Skill hierarchy. Subclasses of this would be directly asserted. But would only be inferred subclasses of communication or detective skills.

Communicative Observational Skills are surely closely associated with listening skills.</rdfs:comment>

        <obo:IAO_0000232>This is probably the only one that should be an actual process. 

It is based on an attrition policy.</obo:IAO_0000232>
        <rdfs:comment>&quot;It is commonly used to describe the downsizing of a firm&apos;s employee pool by human resources (HR) professionals. In this case, downsizing is voluntary, where employees either resign or retire and aren&apos;t replaced by the company.&quot;

This seems to be a multipart process. It involves HR giving employees incentives to resign or retire. And putting a freeze on hiring.

Edit: “Because severe long-term consequences can outweigh any short-term gains, many companies are wary of downsizing, and often take a gentler approach, by cutting work hours, instituting unpaid vacation days, or offering employees incentives to take early retirement.”  
-This suggests that downsizing does not include incentivized retirement.

But then it is different from the way &apos;voluntary attrition&apos; is described. That just seems to refer to any case where there is a reduction in employees. That might occur due to problems in the company, or due to employee personal reasons. But neither of these has to involve any deliberate actions by HR to bring this reduction about.</rdfs:comment>
        <rdfs:comment>I see sources saying this type of downsizing is called a &apos;hiring freeze&apos;. If so, then this is just a case of HR professionals needing to be corrected.

Organizational Attrition is a process that involves a hiring freeze. For HR freezes hiring, but no current employees choose to resign, there would be no reduction in staff numbers.

So: should be a process that:
                       has process part SOME Hiring Freeze

Hiring Freeze: A hiring freeze is when an employer stops hiring workers, usually temporarily, in an effort to contain costs.</rdfs:comment>

Maybe add: 5 USC § 2302(b)) into the ontology as an individual. Say it is part of  5 USC § 2302. Make it an instance of CCO Action Prohibition.

Indeed, I think that there will often be a need to support Aristotelian definitions with elucidations for the purpose of this domain. But that&apos;s the great thing about having separate annotation types!

As for the label, I say &apos;Speech Volume Skill&apos; since a sound technician may have skill in adjusting the loudness of a given sound (perhaps a recording of someone&apos;s else speaking). But that is not the skill we have in mind here.</rdfs:comment>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:elucidation>Elucidation of Logical Definition

A Temporal Appointment Action results in the Employee serving in an appointment that is only expected to last for a specified period of time lasting one year or less. The logical axiom thus says that the appointment results in the Employee serving in an appointment (the Act of Employment) that occurs over a Temporary Appointment Period. A Temporary Appointment Period is a one-dimensional temporal region that spans one year or less. It is a defined class which has its own axiomatization.</CommonCoreOntologies:elucidation>
        <CommonCoreOntologies:elucidation>The time period of a temporory appointment is not to exceed a specified Calendar Day occurring one year or less after their initial Date of appointment. For instance, when a Person is first appointed on January 15, 2024 and the subsequent duration of their appointment is not to exceed October 15, 2024. A Temporary Appointment Action is designated by an OPM Appointment Not-to-exeed (date) Nature of Action Identifier. The Nature of Action Identifer for such an appointment  will contain a Calendar Date Identifier designating the Day that the appointment is not to exceed, e.g. &apos;Appointment Not-To- Exceed October 15, 2024&apos;

Should perhaps say: &quot;after their Effective Date of appointment&quot;</CommonCoreOntologies:elucidation>

        <rdfs:comment>In Chapter 11 of OPM&apos;s Guide Processing Personnel Actions -- which deals with appointments in the Excepted Services -- under Definitions on page 2, it says:
&quot;TIME LIMITED APPOINTMENT—A non-permanent appointment
made for more than 1 year.&quot; [https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation/processing-personnel-actions/gppa11.pdf]
-This would exclude Temporary Appointments, which according to U.S. code, are 1 year or less.

But it seems clear to me that OPM uses &apos;time limited appointment&apos; more broadly in most places.
For example,
Chapter 10 of OPM&apos;s Guide to Processing Personnel Actions [https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation/processing-personnel-actions/gppa10.pdf] is said to cover all competitive services appointments that are time limited, where this include temporary appointments of one year or less. 

So, the use of &apos;Time Limited Appointment&apos; in Chapter 11 appears to me to be a specialized usage. This class represents the broader usage of the term.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Each OPM Nature of Action Code is a numerical string consisting of 3 digits. Strings range 000 to 999. 

The first digit of each code indicates the action type of the action that is described by the corresponding OPM Nature of Action Information Content Entity. For example, for 100 series codes (100-199), &apos;1&apos; indicates that the action type is appointments.

The second and third digits of each code indicates the particular kind of action, for example &apos;promotion&apos;, &apos;resignation&apos;, etc.

An Employee Attrition in which the workforce of an Organization is reduced as a result of employees voluntary leaving the Organization, either to pursue other employment or via retirement or resignation.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>
        <rdfs:comment>&quot;Voluntary attrition occurs when employees leave a company of their own volition.&quot;

Can occur when employees leave for other employment, or they retire.

What does &apos;occurs when&apos; mean here exactly? It seems to me that voluntary attrition is what happens as a result of employees leaving of their own volition. In that case, there are two ways to view this:

&apos;voluntary attrition&apos; is one process
             and
the voluntary leaving of the employees is another. 

It is a reduction in staff numbers that is caused by another process.

Or: 
Voluntary attrition is a process including the employees leaving as a part.

The first option seems more natural to me. But it doesn&apos;t gel well with the deliberate downsizing sense of &apos;attrition&apos; that is carried out by HR.</rdfs:comment>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:elucidation>An Appointment Not-To-Exceed (Date) Identifier consists of the string &apos;Appointment&apos; followed by some Not to Exceed Date Identifier. Temporary Appointments are appointments limited to a specified time period of one year or less. Thus, the Not to Exceed Date Identifier designates a Calendar Day occuring one year or less after the initial Date of appointment. The length of the appointment is therefore not to exceed the designated Calendar Day.

Should perhaps say &apos;effective date&apos; rather than &apos;initial date&apos;.</CommonCoreOntologies:elucidation>

        <rdfs:comment>Although the way that OPM labels it is unfortunate, this is the NOA identifier for temporary appointment actions to positions in the Competitive Services.

Notice also that while a Provisional Appointment is a subtype of Temporary Appointment, as far as I undersand the OPM Guide to Processing Personnel Actions, this NOA is used specifically for temporary appointments in the Competitive Services that are not provisional. Hence the logical axiom</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Not sure how best to label this class. But this class is here to cover the usage of &apos;TIme Limited Appointment&apos; that occurs in section 2 (Definitions) of Chapter 11 of OPM&apos;s Guide To Processing Personnel Actions [https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation/processing-personnel-actions/gppa11.pdf]

&quot;TIME LIMITED APPOINTMENT—A non-permanent appointment
made for more than 1 year.&quot;

According to § 213.104(a)(1) of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, &quot;Time-limited appointments made for more than 1 year are not considered to be temporary appointments&quot; [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/213.104]

So this class covers appointments in the Excepted Services that last for longer than a year, but which are not to exceed a specified date.</rdfs:comment>
